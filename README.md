# DataScience3 UnsupervisedLearning

This repository is used for the clustering into groups by species of the dataset "primate-morphology.csv". 
This dataset contains coordinates from markers of skull features from different primate species.
Unsupervised learning techniques are used to create a model that clusters the data into groups by species.

## Required libraries:
* pandas 1.3.4
* numpy 1.20.3
* matplotlib 3.4.3
* plotly 5.5.0
* seaborn 0.11.2
* scipy 1.7.1
* sklearn 1.0.1

## Usage

Open Final_assignment.ipynb using jupyter notebook, go to "Kernel" and press "Restart and run all" then press "Restart and run all cells"
The notebook shows the steps taken to inspect, clean, and prepare the data. Steps taken for clustering are also present.
